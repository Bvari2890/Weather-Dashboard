# <Weather Dashboard HW>
## Description
In this assignment the goal was to to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

- This assignment was to use a third party API from the "OpenWeather One Call API" to generate the weather from a city entered into the dashboard.  We were to use local storage to store the previously searched cities in a list. From that list you could go check on previous cities as well as enter new ones in the search field.
- We were also supposed to use bootstrap for the CSS and HTML of the dashboard.
- I have gained a better understanding of bootstrap.
